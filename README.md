# Lucy::Goosey

Command line parsing sucks.
`Lucy::Goosey` is the New Jersey style approach to the problem.

It assumes some unix conventions, and doesn't mess with your environment or do anything magic.

Heavily tested.


## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'lucy-goosey'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:
